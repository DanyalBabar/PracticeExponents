# PracticeExponents
.fla and .swf files of my Android Math App, 'Practice Exponents' on Google Play

View the app at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.danyalbabar.practiceexponents&hl=en_CA

The app has lessons for five exponent laws which you can view in an interactive menu.
Then, you can begin a timed quiz with dynamically-generated questions and see your performance after the timer runs out, or you
answer 15 questions.
